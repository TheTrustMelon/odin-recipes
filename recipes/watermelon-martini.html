    <h1>Trust's Watermelon Martini</h1>
      <img src="../images/watermelon-martini.png">
      <h3>A delectable Summer treat or an alcoholic's melony dream (assuming the alcoholic likes watermelon). This martini is sure to dazzle any and all guests that are invited to that sad<br> excuse for a get-together you call a "party." It's okay, not all of us can have a nice below ground pool like Todd. That's why you didn't invite Todd. Don't be like Todd. You don't need<br> Todd, you have the two friends you invited to this "party" and a delicious drink that only you should know the ingredients to!</h3>
      <h6> The glass, chair, TV, remote, and/or straw can count as your two friends if you're really that desperate, although you should really think about making some friends and drinking<br> less.</h6>
